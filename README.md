# Muyan-TTS

## Highlight

Muyan-TTS is a trainable TTS model designed for podcast applications within a $50,000 budget, which is pre-trained on over 100,000 hours of podcast audio data, enabling zero-shot TTS synthesis with high-quality voice generation. Furthermore, Muyan-TTS supports speaker adaptation with dozens of minutes of target speech, making it highly customizable for individual voices. Muyan-TTS makes the following four key contributions:
- **Open-sourcing two TTS models**: (i) a base model pre-trained on diverse podcast datasets, enabling zero-shot TTS synthesis, and (ii) a supervised fine-tuned (SFT) model trained on an individual speaker to enhance TTS performance.
- **Providing a detailed training methodology**: outline the end-to-end training procedure, from the base model to speaker-specific adaptation, and release the full training code for public use.
- **Introducing a data processing pipeline**: propose a comprehensive workflow for data collection, preprocessing, and formatting tailored to TTS model training, improving efficiency and reproducibility.
- **Optimizing inference efficiency**: develop an accelerated TTS inference framework, particularly optimizing the LLM component for faster and more efficient speech generation.

## Summary

![Framework](assets/framework.png)
Framework of Muyan-TTS. Left is an LLM that models the parallel corpus of text (in purple) and audio (in green) tokens. Right is a SoVITS model that decodes the generated audio tokens, as well as phonemes and speaker embeddings, into the audio waveform.

![Pipeline](assets/pipeline.png)
Data processing pipeline. The final dataset comprises over 100,000 hours of high-quality speech and corresponding transcriptions, forming a robust parallel corpus suitable for TTS training in long-form audio scenarios such as podcasts.

| Training Cost   | Data Processing   | Pre-training of LLM| Training of Decoder | Total |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| in GPU Hours   | 60K(A10)   | 19.2K(A100)| 1.34K(A100) | - |
| in USD   | $30K   | $19.2K| $1.34K | $50.54K |

Training costs of Muyan-TTS, assuming the rental price of A10 and A100 in GPU hour is $0.5 and $1, respectively.

## Demo

The three audios in the "Base model" column and the first audio in the "SFT model" column are synthesized by the open-sourced Muyan-TTS and Muyan-TTS-SFT, respectively. The last two audios in the "SFT model" column are generated by the SFT models trained separately on the base model, which are not open for use.
